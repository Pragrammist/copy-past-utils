# Copy past utils
Project for code to copy and past to anothers projects


# Rules 
- util is code snippet; it can be one few lines with one condition or several classes with code
- one util - one file, no matter of file size
- don't change existing util just create new one with the same name and version prefix
- if there's several files with the same name and different version prefixes create new folder for them
- one commit - one util
